*Be sure to take measurements with logging disabled to ensure your logging logic is not impacting current/time measurements.*

*Please include screenshots of the profiler window detailing each current measurement captured.  See the file Instructions to add screenshots in assignment.docx in the ECEN 5823 Student Public Folder.*

4. Provide screen shot showing the connection interval settings. Do they match the values you set in your slave(server) code or the master's(client) values?.
   Answer: Values match as per the connection settings in the output.
